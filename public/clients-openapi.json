    "description" : "# Introduction\nIVA Clients REST API is intended for client applications.\n\nServer to server integration API is described [here](/doc/api/integration.html).\n\nChat bot API is described [here](/doc/api/bot.html).\n\n# Authentication\nMost requests to the system require authorization to perform a certain action.\nSuch requests in the API description are marked with the - `AUTHORIZATIONS` marker.\nFor authorization, the system uses authentication data, which is represented by the identifier of the user session,\nobtained when creating a session (see [User session](#tag/User-session)), and which must be transmitted in the HTTP request header - `Session`.\n\nThere is an additional way to perform authentication by means of IVA ID JWT access token. \nClient should transmit JWT access token in a standard way by using Authorization bearer HTTP header or by cookie with name `ivaid_access`. \nAlso one should register the external IVA ID authentication provider in the IVA, so that it could validate JWT access tokens. \nJWT access tokens are also supported for the web socket connection authentication. \n\nNote: Client is responsible for refreshing access token. \n\n<SecurityDefinitions />\n\n# WebRTC signalling\nWebRTC signaling is performed by a specific media URI (for example, /api/rs/media/proxy/media/9c437e9c-8828-45f0-a12c-7451fe733776_callParticipant?server=10.0.200.50) that can be received by particular method [Get conference media info](#operation/loadMediaInfo) or [Join call](#operation/joinCall).\n\nBefore getting local sdp and ice candidates, you need to configure `RtcConnection` by passing a list of ice servers and constraints (at least the connection direction for the audio/video section: sendonly, recvonly or sendrecv).\n\nNext, we start the process of collecting local sdp (usually RtcConnection#createOffer) and ice candidates (usually RtcConnection#onLocalIceCandidate).\nCandidates gather before the first of these events:\n- all ice candidates are collected;\n- candidate collection timeout (own timer, started for the time obtained from the system settings);\n\nAfter receiving the local sdp and ice candidates, you should make an HTTP POST to the existing URI with the following body:\n\n    {\n        sdp: String,        // local sdp\n        content: String,    // PRIMARY or SECONDARY\n        candidates: [       // array of local ice candidates\n            {\n                sdpMLineIndex: int,\n                sdpMid: String,\n                candidate: String\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\nThen you begin to read data from the answer.\nFirst, the sdp of the remote side will come (answer):\n\n    {\n        sdp: String   // remote sdp\n    }\n\nSet remote sdp to `RtcConnection` (usually RtcConnection#setRemoteSdp).\n\nThen the ice candidates from the remote side will come one by one:\n\n    {\n        candidate: {\n            sdpMLineIndex: int,\n            sdpMid: String,\n            candidate: String\n        }\n    }\n\nAdd remove ice candidate to `RtcConnection` (usually RtcConnection#addRemoveIceCandidate). After the start of adding candidates, `RtcConnection` will start trying to establish a connection and send appropriate events about changing its status.\n\nAttention: You need to read the data and work with them without waiting for the end of the answer. The HTTP signaling connection will close itself.\n\n\n\n# WebRTC2 signalling\nWebRTC2 signaling is performed by a specific media URI using WebSocket (for example, /websocket/api/signalling/c83dcd59-8559-38e2-b578-d0b1225b870e?server=10.0.200.50&contentType=CONFERENCE_PARTICIPANT_PRIMARY&sourceNetworkType=INTERNAL&signature=yM_5nZcT7gmsapnGzGfdMS4vLmk4oNl-rg1Y8bRz60k) that can be received by particular method [Get conference media info](#operation/loadMediaInfo).\n\nUseful articles:\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Signaling_and_video_calling\n- https://wiki.hi-tech.org/display/IVCS/WebRTC+v2+api\n",

        "description" : "Subscribe to event channel is using by WebSocket protocol.\n<br/><br/>\nFirst, connect to this url over websocket protocol.\nAfter connecting you will be able to receive events from server.\n<br/><br/>\nIf channel is empty for 30 seconds then connection is closed by the server.\nTwo ways of checking if channel is alive are client heartbeat messages and server ping.\nBy default client ping is being used.\n<br/><br/>\nTo use server pings one must establish websocket connection using query parameter <code>pingPongDirection</code> with value <code>server</code>.\nClient should respond with pong on server ping. Web browsers do this automatically. Other clients should take care of it by itself.\nOtherwise client ping will be used.\n<br/><br/>\nIn client ping mode it is the client responsibility to ping the server.\nTo ping send the text message <code>ping-[ping_number]</code> where <code>[ping_number]</code> is any unique identifier.\nIn response server will send you back <code>pong-[ping_number]</code> where <code>[ping_number]</code> is the identifier you used to send ping.\nOne approach for ping number is a simple integer counter.\n<br/><br/>\nOther reasons why connection could be closed are the following: user session has expired, I\\O error on a network channel, user has logged out.\n<br/><br/>\nAll server events are wrapped into so called `NumberedMessage` which us used for controlling the sequence \nof receiving messages and possible message losses:\n<pre>\n{\n    \"sequenceNumber\": 410,\n    \"message\": ..., // server message\n    \"_class\": \"NumberedMessage\"\n}\n</pre>\nIn its turn `NumberedMessage` can be wrapped up into `BulkMessage` if multiple messages are being sent at once:\n<pre>\n{\n    \"events\": [...], // list of server events\n    \"_class\": \"BulkMessage\"\n}\n</pre>\n<br/>\n<h3>Message sequence integrity control</h3>\nTo keep strict messages order and integrity control server uses `sequenceNumber` for each server message. The `sequenceNumber` lives in scope of one user session (regardless of the presence and number of open event channels). Each attempt to send server message to active user sessionserver increments this `sequenceNumber`.<br/><br/>\nIn order to check potential server message losses you need to save `sequenceNumber` of the last received `NumberedMessage` and constantly check `sequenceNumber` of newly received message. Logic of check depends on type of message:\n<br/><br/>\n<b>1. Channel synchronization message</b> - during each open channel connection server sends sync message where \"message\" is absent. This message contains `sequenceNumber` of last sent message. From this follows the conclusion:<ul>\n<li>serverSequenceNumber = 0 - means there are no messages for this user session yet (probably, new user session is used);</li>\n<li>serverSequenceNumber = clientSequenceNumber - means no losses - you can continue work normally;</li>\n<li>serverSequenceNumber > clientSequenceNumber - means server messages lost - needs refresh client data;</li>\n<li>serverSequenceNumber < clientSequenceNumber - virtually impossible case - you can ignore this (probably, error in client logic);</li>\n</ul>\nAttention: In your logic you may need to differ cases of channel open for new user session or channel reconnection for same user session to correctly manage comparison of serverSequenceNumber and clientSequenceNumber. This can be done, for example, by special value (for instance, -1) for clientSequenceNumberfor channel open for new user session.\n<br/><br/>\n<b>2. New server message</b> - any `NumberedMessage` after channel synchronization message:<ul>\n<li>serverSequenceNumber > clientSequenceNumber + 1 - means server messages lost - needs refresh client data;</li>\n<li>serverSequenceNumber = clientSequenceNumber + 1 - means no losses - message can be used;</li>\n<li>serverSequenceNumber < clientSequenceNumber + 1 - received duplicated messages - message should be filtered out</li>\n</ul>\n<br/><br/>\n<h3>Disconnection handling</h3>\nAt any unexpected close event in the socket clients should try to reconnect it. Exception is reason 1008 (VIOLATED_POLICY) which means that clients should make authentication at first (in case of user session is expired).",
